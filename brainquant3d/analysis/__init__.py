bq3danalysis and statistics toolbox.

This part of bq3dprovides a toolbox for the statistical analysis and
visualization of detected cells or structures and region specific analysis
of annotated data.

For cleared mouse brains aligned to the Allen brain atlas, a wide range of 
statistical analysis tools with respect to the annotated brain regions in 
the atlas is supported.

Key modules are:
